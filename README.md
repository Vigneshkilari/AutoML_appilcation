# AutoML Application with LLM Chatbot

This project is a comprehensive AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) application built with Streamlit. The application supports various machine learning algorithms, provides insightful data exploration tools, and includes an integrated LLM (Language Model) based chatbot that runs locally without requiring an API key. The entire process is visualized through an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload CSV or Excel files to explore and analyze your data.
- **Data Exploration**: Visualize and analyze your dataset with basic statistics, correlation matrices, and distribution plots.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest with an easy-to-use interface.
- **AI Chatbot**: A simple chatbot powered by a locally running pre-trained LLM model for interactive AI-assisted conversations.
- **Visualization**: Real-time visualization of data and model performance using plots and heatmaps.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Clone the repository:**
